# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide project was build to make studying a lot easier for new boot camp students like myself. One of the main problem this project solves is keeping track of the information I have learned throughout the Prework in one place. There is a total of four sections HTML, CSS, git and JavaScript each one of these section contains valuable information that I learned. The biggest motivation on creating this project was to build a user-friendly website that I can use as a study guide. Throughout the Prework I learned all the building blocks on how a website is put together using different types technologies.
