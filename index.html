        <h2>HTML</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>HTML is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basics framework for all pages on the web</li>
          <li>The head element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browswer to render the page correctly</li>
          <li>The elements included within the Head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown ot the user</li>
          <li>All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>
        <li>CSS is used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users such as the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization.</li>
        <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>
        <li>Inline CSS is used by developers when they want to style an element directly in the HTML file.</li>
        <li>Internal CSS style sheet</li>
        <li>External CSS style sheet is the most common way to style a webpage. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
        <li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use.</li>
        <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
        <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
        <li>To apply a rule to all elements visible on a page we use a special wild card symbol, or * as part of the declaration block. </li>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>

        <ul>
          
        <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
        <li>GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored repotely.</li>
        <li>GitHub makes developers work easier not only by storing our code but we can easily collaborate with others</li>
        <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
        <li>git checkout: -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
        <li>git branch -d branch-name: deletes branch locally</li>
        <li>git push origin --delete branch-name: deletes branch remotely</li>
        <li>Developers use SHA to access a version of their code, often using only the first seven numbers or letters.</li>
        <li></li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
          <li>In web development, JavaScript is the tool that takes a static HTML/CSS webpage and makes it interactive. Every time you do something with a webpage, such as click a button, retrieve data, or fill out a form is all because of Javascript.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. Just like its name sounds, when using the if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>To create an array, we declare a variable in the same way that we declared a variable with only one data item. That is, we use var and then give the variable a name. However, instead of assigning the variable to a single value, we assign the variable to a group of values.</li>
          <li>To work with individual data items inside an array, we need to have one more piece of information: the location of the data item in the array. This location is identified with a unique number called an index.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>Developers must use another statement, such as the conditional if statement to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times.</li>
          <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task</li>
          <li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file (in our case, script.js) is run. Instead, you must call a function by name in order to execute it.</li>
          <li>A function declaration uses the function keyword and the function name to define a function.</li>
          <li>To execute the function, we need to call the function to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times.</li>
          <li>We use functions in JavaScript to define and reuse blocks of code </li>
          <li></li>
