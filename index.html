        <h2>HTML</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>HTML is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basics framework for all pages on the web</li>
          <li>The head element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browswer to render the page correctly</li>
          <li>The elements included within the Head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown ot the user</li>
          <li>All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>
        <li>CSS is used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users such as the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization.</li>
        <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>
        <li>Inline CSS is used by developers when they want to style an element directly in the HTML file.</li>
        <li>Internal CSS style sheet</li>
        <li>External CSS style sheet is the most common way to style a webpage. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
        <li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use.</li>
        <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
        <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
        <li>To apply a rule to all elements visible on a page we use a special wild card symbol, or * as part of the declaration block. </li>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>

        <ul>
          
        <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
        <li>GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored repotely.</li>
        <li>GitHub makes developers work easier not only by storing our code but we can easily collaborate with others</li>
        <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
        <li>git checkout: -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
        <li>git branch -d branch-name: deletes branch locally</li>
        <li>git push origin --delete branch-name: deletes branch remotely</li>
        <li>Developers use SHA to access a version of their code, often using only the first seven numbers or letters.</li>
